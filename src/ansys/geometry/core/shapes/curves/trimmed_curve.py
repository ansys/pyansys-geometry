    are handled to provide expected results conforming to the direction of the curve. For example,
    evaluating a trimmed curve proportionally at 0 evaluates at the start point of the curve,
    but evaluating a reversed trimmed curve proportionally at 0 evaluates at what was previously
    the end point of the curve but is now the start point.

    start : Point3D
