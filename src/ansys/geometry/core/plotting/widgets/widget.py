    Provides an abstract class for plotter widgets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    plotter : ~pyvista.Plotter
        Plotter instance to add the widget to.

    Notes
    -----
    These widgets are intended to be used with PyVista plotter objects.
    More specifically, the way in which this abstraction has been built
    ensures that these widgets are easily integrable with PyAnsys Geometry's
    own ``Plotter`` class.
