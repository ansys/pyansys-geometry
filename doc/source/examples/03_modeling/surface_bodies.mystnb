# Modeling: Surface bodies and trimmed surfaces

This example shows how to trim different surfaces, and how to use those surfaces
to create surface bodies.

## Create a surface

Create a sphere surface. This can be done without launching the modeler.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from ansys.geometry.core.shapes.surfaces import Sphere
from ansys.geometry.core.math import Point3D

surface = Sphere(origin=Point3D([0, 0, 0]), radius=1)
```

Now get information on how the surface is defined and parameterized.

```{code-cell} ipython3
surface.parameterization()
```

## Trim the surface

For a sphere, its parametization is (`u: [0, 2*pi]`, `v:[-pi/2, pi/2]`),
where u corresponds to longitude and v corresponds to latitude. You
can **trim** a surface by providing new parameters.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from ansys.geometry.core.shapes.box_uv import BoxUV
from ansys.geometry.core.shapes.parameterization import Interval
import math

trimmed_surface = surface.trim(BoxUV(range_u=Interval(0, math.pi), range_v=Interval(0, math.pi/2)))
```

From a ``TrimmedSurface``, you can always refer back to the underlying ``Surface`` if needed.

```{code-cell} ipython3
trimmed_surface.geometry
```

## Create a surface body

Now create a surface body by launching the modeler session and providing the trimmed surface.
Then plot the body to see how you created a quarter of a sphere as a surface body.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from ansys.geometry.core import launch_modeler

modeler = launch_modeler()
print(modeler)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
design = modeler.create_design("SurfaceBodyExample")
body = design.create_body_from_surface("trimmed_sphere", trimmed_surface)
design.plot()
```

If the sphere was left untrimmed, it would create a solid body since the surface is fully
closed. In this case, since the surface was open, it created a surface body.

This same process can be used with other surfaces including:
- ``Cone``
- ``Cylinder``
- ``Plane``
- ``Torus``

Each surface has its own unique parameterization, which must be understood before trying to trim it.

## Close session

When you finish interacting with your modeling service, you should close the active server
session. This frees resources wherever the service is running.

Close the server session.

```{code-cell} ipython3
modeler.close()
```
