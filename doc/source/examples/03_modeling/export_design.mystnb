# Modeling: Exporting designs

After creating a design, you typically want to bring it into a CAD tool for further
development. This notebook demonstrates how to export a design to the various supported
CAD formats.

## Create a design

The code creates a simple design for demonstration purposes. The design consists of
a set of rectangular pads with a circular hole in the center.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from ansys.geometry.core import launch_modeler
from ansys.geometry.core.math import UNITVECTOR3D_X, UNITVECTOR3D_Y, Point2D
from ansys.geometry.core.sketch import Sketch

# Instantiate the modeler
modeler = launch_modeler()

# Create a design
design = modeler.create_design("ExportDesignExample")

# Create a sketch
sketch = Sketch()

# Create a simple rectangle
sketch.box(Point2D([0, 0]), 10, 5)

# Extrude the sketch and displace the resulting body
# to make a plane of rectangles
for x_step in [-60, -45, -30, -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60]:
    for y_step in [-40, -30, -20, -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40]:
        # Extrude the sketch
        body = design.extrude_sketch(f"Body_X_{x_step}_Y_{y_step}", sketch, 5)

        # Displace the body in the x and y directions
        body.translate(UNITVECTOR3D_X, x_step)
        body.translate(UNITVECTOR3D_Y, y_step)

# Plot the design
design.plot()
```

## Export the design

You can export the design to various CAD formats. For the formats supported
see the [DesignFileFormat](https://geometry.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/api/ansys/geometry/core/designer/design/DesignFileFormat.html)
class, which is part of the the ``design`` module documentation.

Nonetheless, there are a set of convenience methods that you can use to export
the design to the supported formats. The following code snippets demonstrate how
to do it. You can decide whether to export the design to a file in
a certain directory or in the current working directory.

### Export to a file in the current working directory

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Export the design to a file in the current working directory
file_location = design.export_to_scdocx()
print(f"Design exported to {file_location}")
```

### Export to a file in a certain directory

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pathlib import Path

# Define a downloads directory
download_dir = Path.cwd() / "downloads"

# Export the design to a file in a certain directory
file_location = design.export_to_scdocx(download_dir)
print(f"Design exported to {file_location}")
```

### Export to SCDOCX format

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Export the design to a file in the requested directory
file_location = design.export_to_scdocx(download_dir)

# Print the file location
print(f"Design exported to {file_location}")
print(f"Does the file exist? {Path(file_location).exists()}")
```

### Export to Parasolid text format

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Export the design to a file in the requested directory
file_location = design.export_to_parasolid_text(download_dir)

# Print the file location
print(f"Design exported to {file_location}")
print(f"Does the file exist? {Path(file_location).exists()}")
```

### Export to Parasolid binary format

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Export the design to a file in the requested directory
file_location = design.export_to_parasolid_bin(download_dir)

# Print the file location
print(f"Design exported to {file_location}")
print(f"Does the file exist? {Path(file_location).exists()}")
```

### Export to STEP format

```python
# Export the design to a file in the requested directory
file_location = design.export_to_step(download_dir)

# Print the file location
print(f"Design exported to {file_location}")
print(f"Does the file exist? {Path(file_location).exists()}")
```

### Export to IGES format

```python
# Export the design to a file in the requested directory
file_location = design.export_to_iges(download_dir)

# Print the file location
print(f"Design exported to {file_location}")
print(f"Does the file exist? {Path(file_location).exists()}")
```

### Export to FMD format

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Export the design to a file in the requested directory
file_location = design.export_to_fmd(download_dir)

# Print the file location
print(f"Design exported to {file_location}")
print(f"Does the file exist? {Path(file_location).exists()}")
```

### Export to PMDB format

```python
# Export the design to a file in the requested directory
file_location = design.export_to_pmdb(download_dir)
```

### Export to Discovery format

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Export the design to a file in the requested directory
file_location = design.export_to_disco(download_dir)

# Print the file location
print(f"Design exported to {file_location}")
print(f"Does the file exist? {Path(file_location).exists()}")
```

### Close the modeler

Close the modeler after exporting the design.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Close the modeler
modeler.close()
```
