"""Module containing the repair tools service implementation (abstraction layer).

This module defines an abstract base class for a gRPC-based repair tools service.
The class provides a set of abstract methods for identifying and repairing various
geometry issues, such as split edges, extra edges, duplicate faces, and more.
