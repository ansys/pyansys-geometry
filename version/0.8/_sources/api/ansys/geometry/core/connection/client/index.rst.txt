Module detail
-------------

.. py:function:: wait_until_healthy(channel: grpc.Channel, timeout: float)

   
   Wait until a channel is healthy before returning.


   :Parameters:

       **channel** : :obj:`~grpc.Channel`
           Channel that must be established and healthy.

       **timeout** : :class:`python:float`
           Timeout in seconds. Attempts are made with the following backoff strategy:
           
           * Starts with 0.1 seconds.
           * If the attempt fails, double the timeout.
           * This is repeated until the next timeoff exceeds the
             value for the remaining time. In that case, a final attempt
             is made with the remaining time.
           * If the total elapsed time exceeds the value for the ``timeout`` parameter,
             a ``TimeoutError`` is raised.







   :Raises:

       :obj:`TimeoutError`
           Raised when the total elapsed time exceeds the value for the ``timeout`` parameter.
