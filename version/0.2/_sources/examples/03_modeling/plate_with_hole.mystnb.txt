# Modeling: rectangular plate with multiple bodies

You can create multiple bodies from a single sketch by extruding the same sketch in different planes.

The sketch is designed as an effective 'fluent functional-style' API with all operations receiving 2D configurations.
To know more about the API, see [Fluent functional-style API in Sketch](../../user_guide/shapes.rst).

In this example, a box is located in the center of the plate, with the default origin of a sketch plane (origin at ``(0, 0, 0)``).
Four holes of equal radius are sketched at the corners of the plate.
The plate is then extruded, leading to the generation of the requested body.
The projection is at the center of the face. The default projection depth is through the entire part.

## Perform required imports

Start by performing required imports.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
from pint import Quantity

from ansys.geometry.core import Modeler
from ansys.geometry.core.math import Plane, Point3D, Point2D, UnitVector3D
from ansys.geometry.core.misc import UNITS
from ansys.geometry.core.sketch import Sketch
```

## Define a sketch profile for the proposed design

The sketch profile requires four segments that constitute the outer limits of the design,
a box on the center, and a circle at its four corners.

You can use a single sketch instance for multiple design operations such as extruding a body,
projecting a profile, or imprinting curves.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sketch = Sketch()
(sketch.segment(Point2D([-4, 5], unit=UNITS.m), Point2D([4, 5], unit=UNITS.m))
    .segment_to_point(Point2D([4, -5], unit=UNITS.m))
    .segment_to_point(Point2D([-4, -5], unit=UNITS.m))
    .segment_to_point(Point2D([-4, 5], unit=UNITS.m))
    .box(Point2D([0,0], unit=UNITS.m), Quantity(3, UNITS.m), Quantity(3, UNITS.m))
    .circle(Point2D([3, 4], unit=UNITS.m), Quantity(0.5, UNITS.m))
    .circle(Point2D([-3, -4], unit=UNITS.m), Quantity(0.5, UNITS.m))
    .circle(Point2D([-3, 4], unit=UNITS.m), Quantity(0.5, UNITS.m))
    .circle(Point2D([3, -4], unit=UNITS.m), Quantity(0.5, UNITS.m))
)
```

## Create the design by extruding the sketch

Establish a server connection and use the single sketch profile to extrude
the base component at the Z axis. A named selection is created from the
resulting list of bodies. In only three server calls, the design extrudes
the four segments with the desired thickness.

```{code-cell} ipython3
modeler = Modeler()
design = modeler.create_design("ExtrudedPlate")

body = design.extrude_sketch(f"PlateLayer", sketch, Quantity(2, UNITS.m))

board_named_selection = design.create_named_selection("Plate", bodies=[body])
design.plot()
```

## Add a component with a planar surface

After creating a plate as a base component, you might want to add a component with a planar surface to it.
You create a ``sketch`` instance and create a surface in the design with this sketch.
For the sketch, create an ellipse, keeping the origin of the plane as its center.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Add components to the design
planar_component = design.add_component("PlanarComponent")

# Initiate ``Sketch`` to create the planar surface.
planar_sketch = Sketch()
planar_sketch.ellipse(
        Point2D([0, 0], UNITS.m), Quantity(1, UNITS.m), Quantity(0.5, UNITS.m)
    )

planar_body = planar_component.create_surface("PlanarComponentSurface", planar_sketch)

comp_str = repr(planar_component)
design.plot()
```

## Extrude from face to create body

You can extrude a face profile by a given distance to create a solid body.
There are no modifications against the body containing the source face.

```{code-cell} ipython3
longer_body = design.extrude_face(
        "LongerEllipseFace", planar_body.faces[0], Quantity(5, UNITS.m)
    )
design.plot()
```
## Translate the body within the plane

By using the translate method, you can move the body in a specified direction by a given distance.
You can also move a sketch around the global coordinate system. For more information, see
[Dynamic Sketch Plane](../02_sketching/dynamic_sketch_plane.mystnb).

```{code-cell} ipython3
longer_body.translate(UnitVector3D([1, 0, 0]), Quantity(4, UNITS.m))
design.plot()
```
