PyAnsys Geometry overview
=========================

PyAnsys Geometry is a Python wrapper for the Ansys Geometry service.
Here are some of the key features of PyAnsys Geometry:

* Ability to use the library alongside other Python libraries
* A *functional-style* API for a clean and easy coding experience
* Built-in examples

Simple interactive example
==========================
This simple interactive example shows how to start an instance of
the Geometry server and create a geometry model.

Start Geometry server instance
------------------------------

The :class:`Modeler() <ansys.geometry.core.modeler()>` class
within the ``ansys-geometry-core`` library creates an instance of
the Geometry service. By default, the ``Modeler`` instance connects to
``127.0.0.1`` (``"localhost"``) on port ``50051``. You can change this
by modifying the ``host`` and ``port`` parameters of the ``Modeler`` object,
but note that you must also modify your ``docker run`` command by changing
the ``<HOST-PORT>:50051`` argument.

This code starts an instance of the Geometry service:

.. code:: pycon

    >>> from ansys.geometry.core import Modeler
    >>> modeler = Modeler()

Create geometry model
---------------------

Once an instance has started, you can create a
geometry model by initializing the :ref:`Sketch <ref_sketch>` subpackage and using the
:ref:`Primitives <ref_primitives>` subpackage.

.. code:: python

    from ansys.geometry.core.math import Plane, Point3D, Point2D
    from ansys.geometry.core.misc import UNITS
    from ansys.geometry.core.sketch import Sketch

    # Define our sketch
    origin = Point3D([0, 0, 10])
    plane = Plane(origin, direction_x=[1, 0, 0], direction_y=[0, 1, 0])

    # Create the sketch
    sketch = Sketch(plane)
    sketch.circle(Point2D([1, 1]), 30 * UNITS.m)
    sketch.plot()

.. jupyter-execute::
    :hide-code:

    from ansys.geometry.core.math import Plane, Point3D, Point2D
    from ansys.geometry.core.misc import UNITS
    from ansys.geometry.core.sketch import Sketch

    origin = Point3D([0, 0, 10])
    plane = Plane(origin, direction_x=[1, 0, 0], direction_y=[0, 1, 0])
    sketch = Sketch(plane)
    sketch.circle(Point2D([1, 1]), 30 * UNITS.m)
    sketch.plot()
