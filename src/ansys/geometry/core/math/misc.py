    Get the intersection points of two circles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x0 : Real
        x coordinate of the first circle.
    y0 : Real
        y coordinate of the first circle.
    r0 : Real
        Radius of the first circle.
    x1 : Real
        x coordinate of the second circle.
    y1 : Real
        y coordinate of the second circle.
    r1 : Real
        Radius of the second circle.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is based on the following StackOverflow post:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55816902/finding-the-intersection-of-two-circles

    That post is based on the following implementation:

    Returns
    -------
    Union[Tuple[Tuple[Real, Real], Tuple[Real, Real]], None]
        Intersection points of the two circles if they intersect.
        The points are returned as ``((x3, y3), (x4, y4))``, where ``(x3, y3)`` and ``(x4, y4)``
        are the intersection points of the two circles. If the circles do not
        intersect, then ``None`` is returned.
