# Single body with material assignment

In PyGeometry, a ``Body`` represents solids or surfaces organized within the ``Design`` assembly.
The current state of ``Sketch``, which is a client-side execution, can be used for the operations of
the geometric design assembly. The Geometry Service also provides data structures to create individual materials 
and its properties, which are also exposed through PyGeometry.

This example demonstrates how to create a single body from a sketch, by requesting its extrusion,
and how to assign a material to it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pint import Quantity

from ansys.geometry.core import Modeler
from ansys.geometry.core.materials import Material, MaterialProperty, MaterialPropertyType
from ansys.geometry.core.math import UNITVECTOR3D_Z, Frame, Plane, Point2D, Point3D, UnitVector3D
from ansys.geometry.core.misc import UNITS
from ansys.geometry.core.sketch import Sketch
```
## Defining the ``Sketch``

Create a basic ``circle`` sketch instance with radius 10mm in the default plane.

```{code-cell} ipython3
sketch = Sketch()
sketch.circle(Point2D([10, 10], UNITS.mm), Quantity(10, UNITS.mm))
```

## Initiate the design in the server

A server connection is established and a design has been initiated.
```{code-cell} ipython3
modeler = Modeler()
design_name = "ExtrudeProfile"
design = modeler.create_design(design_name)
```

## Add materials to the design

Adding materials and its properties to the design. Additional properties of
the material can be added at construction of the ``Material`` object or afterwards,
as it is shown in the code snippet.
```{code-cell} ipython3
density = Quantity(125, 10 * UNITS.kg / (UNITS.m * UNITS.m * UNITS.m))
poisson_ratio = Quantity(0.33, UNITS.dimensionless)
tensile_strength = Quantity(45)
material = Material(
    "steel",
    density,
    [MaterialProperty(MaterialPropertyType.POISSON_RATIO, "PoissonRatio", poisson_ratio)],
)
material.add_property(MaterialPropertyType.TENSILE_STRENGTH, "TensileProp", Quantity(45))
design.add_material(material)
```
## Extrude the body from the sketch

Extrude the sketch to create the body and assign a material to it.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Extrude the sketch to create a Body
body = design.extrude_sketch("SingleBody", sketch, Quantity(10, UNITS.mm))

# Assign a material to a Body
body.assign_material(material)

body.plot()
```
