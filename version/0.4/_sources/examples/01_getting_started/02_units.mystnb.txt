# PyAnsys Geometry 101: Units

To handle units inside the source code, PyAnsys Geometry uses [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
a third-party open source software that other PyAnsys libraries also use.

The following code examples show how to operate with units inside
the PyAnsys Geometry codebase and create objects with different units.

+++

## Import units handler

The following line of code imports the units handler: ``pint.util.UnitRegistry``.
For more information on the ``UnitRegistry`` class in the ``pint`` API, see
[Most important classes](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/base.html#most-important-classes)
in the Pint documentation.

```{code-cell} ipython3

from ansys.geometry.core.misc import UNITS

```

+++

## Create and work with ``Quantity`` objects

With the ``UnitRegistry`` object called ``UNITS``, you can create ``Quantity``
objects. A ``Quantity`` object is simply a container class with two core elements:

- A number
- A unit

``Quantity`` objects have convenience methods, including those for transforming to
different units and comparing magnitudes, values, and units. For more information on the
``Quantity`` class in the ``pint`` API, see
[Most important classes](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/base.html#most-important-classes)
in the Pint documentation. You can also step through this
[Pint tutorial](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting/tutorial.html).

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pint import Quantity

a = Quantity(10, UNITS.mm)

print(f"Object a is a pint.Quantity: {a}")

print("Request its magnitude in different ways (accessor methods):")
print(f"Magnitude: {a.m}.")
print(f"Also magnitude: {a.magnitude}.")

print("Request its units in different ways (accessor methods):")
print(f"Units: {a.u}.")
print(f"Also units: {a.units}.")

# Quantities can be compared between different units
# You can also build Quantity objects as follows:
a2 = 10 * UNITS.mm
print(f"Compare quantities built differently: {a == a2}")

# Quantities can be compared between different units
a2_diff_units = 1 * UNITS.cm
print(f"Compare quantities with different units: {a == a2_diff_units}")
```

PyAnsys Geometry objects work by returning ``Quantity`` objects whenever the
property requested has a physical meaning.

Return ``Quantity`` objects for ``Point3D`` objects.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from ansys.geometry.core.math import Point3D

point_a = Point3D([1,2,4])
print("========================= Point3D([1,2,4]) ========================")
print(f"Point3D is a numpy.ndarray in SI units: {point_a}.")
print(f"However, request each of the coordinates individually...\n")
print(f"X Coordinate: {point_a.x}")
print(f"Y Coordinate: {point_a.y}")
print(f"Z Coordinate: {point_a.z}\n")

# Now, store the information with different units...
point_a_km = Point3D([1,2,4], unit=UNITS.km)
print("================= Point3D([1,2,4], unit=UNITS.km) =================")
print(f"Point3D is a numpy.ndarray in SI units: {point_a_km}.")
print(f"However, request each of the coordinates individually...\n")
print(f"X Coordinate: {point_a_km.x}")
print(f"Y Coordinate: {point_a_km.y}")
print(f"Z Coordinate: {point_a_km.z}\n")

# These points, although they are in different units, can be added together.
res = point_a + point_a_km

print("=================== res = point_a + point_a_km ====================")
print(f"numpy.ndarray: {res}")
print(f"X Coordinate: {res.x}")
print(f"Y Coordinate: {res.y}")
print(f"Z Coordinate: {res.z}")
```

+++

## Use default units

PyAnsys Geometry implements the concept of *default units*.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from ansys.geometry.core.misc import DEFAULT_UNITS

print("=== Default unit length ===")
print(DEFAULT_UNITS.LENGTH)

print("=== Default unit angle ===")
print(DEFAULT_UNITS.ANGLE)
```

It is important to differentiate between *client-side* default units
and *server-side* default units. You are able to control both of them.

Print the default server unit length.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("=== Default server unit length ===")
print(DEFAULT_UNITS.SERVER_LENGTH)
```

Use default units.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from ansys.geometry.core.math import Point2D
from ansys.geometry.core.misc import DEFAULT_UNITS

DEFAULT_UNITS.LENGTH = UNITS.mm

point_2d_default_units = Point2D([3, 4])
print("This is a Point2D with default units")
print(f"X Coordinate: {point_2d_default_units.x}")
print(f"Y Coordinate: {point_2d_default_units.y}")
print(f"numpy.ndarray value: {point_2d_default_units}")

# Revert back to original default units
DEFAULT_UNITS.LENGTH = UNITS.m
```

PyAnsys Geometry has certain auxiliary classes implemented that provide proper
unit checking when assigning values. Although they are basically intended for
internal use of the library, you can define them for use.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from ansys.geometry.core.misc import Angle, Distance
```

Start with ``Distance``. The main difference between a ``Quantity`` object
(that is, ``from pint import Quantity``) and a ``Distance`` is that there
is an active check on the units passed (in case they are not the default ones).
Here are some examples.

```{code-cell} ipython3
radius = Distance(4)
print(f"The radius is {radius.value}.")

# Reassign the value of the distance
radius.value = 7 * UNITS.cm
print(f"After reassignment, the radius is {radius.value}.")


# Change the units if desired
radius.unit = UNITS.cm
print(f"After changing its units, the radius is {radius.value}.")
```

The next two code examples show how unreasonable operations raise errors.

```{code-cell} ipython3
try:
    radius.value = 3 * UNITS.degrees
except TypeError as err:
    print(f"Error raised: {err}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
try:
    radius.unit = UNITS.fahrenheit
except TypeError as err:
    print(f"Error raised: {err}")
```

The same behavior applies to the ``Angle`` object. Here are some examples.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

rotation_angle = Angle(np.pi / 2)
print(f"The rotation angle is {rotation_angle.value}.")

# Try reassigning the value of the distance
rotation_angle.value = 7 * UNITS.degrees
print(f"After reassignment, the rotation angle is {rotation_angle.value}.")

# You could also change its units if desired
rotation_angle.unit = UNITS.degrees
print(f"After changing its units, the rotation angle is {rotation_angle.value}.")
```
