class _GRPCServices:

    Placeholder for the gRPC services (i.e. stubs).

    Notes
    -----
    This class provides a unified interface to access the different
    gRPC services available in the Geometry API. It allows for easy
    switching between different versions of the API by using the
    `version` parameter in the constructor. The services are lazy-loaded
    to avoid unnecessary imports and to improve performance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    channel : grpc.Channel
        The gRPC channel to the server.
    version : GeometryApiProtos | str | None
        The version of the gRPC API protocol to use. If None, the latest
        version is used.
    """

        ----------
        channel : grpc.Channel

        version : GeometryApiProtos | str | None
