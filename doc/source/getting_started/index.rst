PyAnsys Geometry is a Python client library for the Ansys Geometry service.

This client library works with a Geometry service backend. This service is distributed
mainly as a Docker container. For more information, see :ref:`Geometry service using Docker <ref_docker>`. If you
want to use a local version of the Geometry Service distributed with the Ansys Unified Install,  please refer
to :ref:`Create a local session <ref_creating_local_session>`.
