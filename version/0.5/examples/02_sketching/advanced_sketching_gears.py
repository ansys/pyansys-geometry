# ## Sketch a spur gear
#
# ``SpurGear`` sketches are parametric CAD spur gears based on four parameters:
#
# * ``origin``: Center point location for the desired spur gear. The value must
#   be a ``Point2D`` object.
# * ``module``: Ratio between the pitch circle diameter in millimeters and the
#   number of teeth. This is a common parameter for spur gears. The value should
#   be an integer or a float.
# * ``pressure_angle``: Pressure angle expected for the teeth of the spur gear.
#   This is also a common parameter for spur gears. The value must be a
#   ``pint.Quantity`` object.
# * ``n_teeth``: Number of teeth. The value must be an integer.
#
# Instantiate a new ``Sketch`` object and then define and plot a spur gear.

# +
# Instantiate a new sketch object from previous plane

# Define spur gear
